## Enhancer/regulatory architecture across tissues with low/high expression variance correlation

Main questions: 

### Are there different regulatory signals between tissues that exhibit high vs. low correlation in gene expression variance?
  1. What is the pairwise overlap of enhancers in high vs. low correlation tissues? 
  - Hypothesis could be that there is higher overlap in those with high correlation but just because genes are high-variance in two tissues doesn't necessarily mean they should exhibit regulation from similar elements
  - Instead, there could just be similar numbers of regulatory elements associated with high-variance genes across tissues (i.e., if tissue 1 and 2 have high variance correlation and gene X has high variance, maybe gene X has > 10 enhancers in tissues 1 and 2; but tissue 3, which has low variance correlation 



Would be great to identify datasets from the tissues of interest that have many samples from the same tissue so we could see quantitatively how the tissues compare in terms of their regulation - this would be a lot more work as well though
